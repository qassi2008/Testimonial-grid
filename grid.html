            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

            “I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

            “Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
            former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
            and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
            The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
            way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
            example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
            after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!”
